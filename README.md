# Hate Speech Detection Program

I have created a Hate Speech Detector using a Decision Tree Classifier. It's designed to identify hate speech and offensive language in text. The code includes steps to clean and preprocess the data, turning it into a format the model can understand. The machine learning model is trained on a dataset and evaluated for accuracy. Users can also input their own text for on-the-spot analysis. It's a handy tool combining machine learning and natural language processing to spot inappropriate language.

This is my First Program I have created after learning the Basics of Machine Learning!

## Installation

To install and run this project,

You can download the zip file or Clone the Project Repository using Git with the below command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DhruvAthaide/HateSpeechDetection.git
```


Once, you have installed the Repository then you can cd into the directory and pip install the requirements needed to run the tool:
```bash
cd HateSpeechDetection
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

I have provided the Dataset, in a CSV File Format, on which my Decision Tree Classifier trains on to detect Hate Speech.

You can simply run the Jupyter notebook or run the program in Visual Studio Code and enter a Statement to check whether it is a Hate Speech or not!
